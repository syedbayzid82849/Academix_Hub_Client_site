## üîë Key Features

### 1. Multi-Role Functionality & Dashboards

The system implements a critical segregation of duties to manage a dual-role environment.

**Instructor Workflow (CRUD):** Dedicated interface for Course Management, enabling instructors to create, edit, and delete their proprietary content via authenticated API endpoints (`/all-course` routes).

**Learner Management:** Personalized dashboard provides an overview of enrolled courses, recent activity, and progress tracking. Learners can manage their active commitments via the **‚ÄúMy Enrollments‚Äù** view.

**Gamification & Engagement:** Tracks and displays user achievements, course completion, and quiz submissions to drive continuous engagement.

---

### 2. Secure Monetization and Tiered Access

The platform supports a **Freemium / Tiered Subscription Model**, requiring strong security for financial transactions.

**Premium Feature Toggling:** Access to features like *Advanced Task Automation* is conditionally rendered and enforced server-side based on the user‚Äôs `isPremium` status.

**PCI-Compliant Payments:** Integrated with **Stripe** to handle card processing securely via hosted checkout pages‚Äîensuring zero direct handling of sensitive data (Tokenization).

**Webhooks for Provisioning:** The user‚Äôs Premium status is updated asynchronously using a **server-to-server Stripe Webhook** (`/api/webhook`), guaranteeing access only upon successful payment confirmation.

---

### 3. Data Integrity and Reporting

**Dynamic Reporting:** The backend leverages **MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline** (`$lookup`, `$group`) for relational-style joins and reporting‚Äîsuch as identifying *Popular Courses*.

**Enrollment Management:** Dedicated logic manages enrollment records, maintaining consistency between `users` and `courses` collections through `/myEnrolls` API.

## üîí Architectural Highlights

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Enforced via server-side authorization middleware that validates user roles for sensitive requests (e.g., course creation, deletion).
* **Object-Level Security:** Instructors can only modify courses where their `instructorEmail` matches the course record, preventing unauthorized content modification.

### 2. DevOps & Code Quality

* **CI/CD Ready:** Version-controlled project compatible with automated deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify) and GitHub Actions for CI.
* **Testing Strategy:** Unit testing via Jest, with plans for integration and end-to-end testing (Playwright/Cypress) for critical workflows.

### 3. Scalable Content Delivery

* **Video Processing Pipeline:** Instructor uploads are transcoded asynchronously into multiple resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 720p).
* **Global Distribution:** Processed content delivered via CDN with Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming for optimal playback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

To run **Academix-Hub** locally, ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file inside the **Server** directory and populate it with:

```bash
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI="<Your-MongoDB-Atlas-Connection-String>"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="<Your-Stripe-Secret-Key>"
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="<Your-Stripe-Webhook-Signing-Secret>"
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"  # Or your client local URL

# Nodemailer Configuration
EMAIL_USER="<Your-Admin-Email>"
EMAIL_PASS="<Your-Admin-Email-App-Password>"
```

### 2. Setup & Run

| Step               | Server (Backend)                                                            | Client (Frontend)                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **1. Clone Repos** | `git clone https://github.com/syedbayzid82849/Academix_Hub_Server_site.git` | (Clone your client repo)                |
| **2. Install**     | `cd Academix_Hub_Server_site && npm install`                                | `cd academix-hub-client && npm install` |
| **3. Run**         | `npm start` (or `npm run dev` with nodemon)                                 | `npm run dev`                           |

The **server** will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` and the **client** on `http://localhost:5173`.
